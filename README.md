<br>

## Reflection Questions
> How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?

push() allowed easy addition to the JavaScript array containing the list of items. <br>
filter() allowed easy condition checking over an array without having to use a for loop.
<br>

> What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?

Understanding the syntax for .filter() took time to understand, however once integrated into the lab .filter() was a clean and easy way to make a search function.
<br>

> How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?

itemList<br>
listItem<br>
shoppingList<br><br>
These variable names, while descriptive, are easy to mix up. listItem can be renamed to imply its local use, e.g. updateItem.
